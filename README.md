# generics-generator-demo
A demo repo for the generics-generator utility

# What to pay attention to
The `Makefile` and the `templates/` folder.

## Makefile
The make targets to make this program reasonable are fairly long.
You must specify
- All of the expected output files
- All of the input files (the main template AND the generator files)
    * This ensures that when you change any of these files the generator runs again

## Templates
You can learn more about the templates on the main repo. [generics-generator](https://github.com/rfmineguy/generics-generator)
